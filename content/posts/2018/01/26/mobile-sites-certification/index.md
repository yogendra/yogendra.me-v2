First one in a while! I just (now) passed my Mobile Site Certifiation from
[Academy for Ads][academy-for-ads]

<!--more-->

![Certificate][certificate]
This is a very good training and certification for anyone who wants to get recognition for their mobile site developement skills. I also learned a great deal about:

- Key Business Metrics for Mobile Sites (Page Value, Exit Rate, Bouce Rate, Convertion Rates, etc.)
- [Using DevTools to Optimize Mobile Sites][devtools]
- [Progressive Web Apps - PWA][pwd]
- [Accelerated Mobile Pages - AMP][amp]

Course and certifications are **FREE** and available online. [GDG-SG][gdg-sg-home] will run training session, next month for this. So watch our group on [FB][gdg-sg-fb] and [Peatix][gdg-sg-peatix] for session details.
