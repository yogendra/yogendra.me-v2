I presented about IoT sensor data at the recently concluded [Distribute SQL Summit - Asia 2022 (DSS Asia 2022)][event-site]. IoT data is unique in some sense, so I started learning about its lifecycle. Its fascinating! imagine millions of machine coming together and talking to each other to support our daily lives. In many ways they substitute human senses. I have only scratched the surface though.

Starting in this space like, most of the tech spaces, can be complicated. So, I presented about my learnings and seeking feedback from fellow "travelers".

Here is a full video of my session ([link][talk-video]). Deck and Code for the presentation is over at [github][talk-repo]. Please provide your comments on this post, twitter, etc. I am also playing with ESP32, Pico PIs currently so I guess there is a good chance of an update on this.
