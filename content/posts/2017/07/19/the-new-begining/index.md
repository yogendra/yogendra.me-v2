This is my attempt to restart. This is my 4th attempt to blog. I started blogging years ago. But something or the other always kept me from writing regularly.

Sometimes I was just lazy to write. But most of the times, I digressed into updating my core, plugins, themes, etc. After all I am a programmer, and I get more satisfaction in creating (read breaking) and fixing stuff.

I don't have any particular agenda for this site. Just get scraps of information from all over the internet and put it in a way that I , and possibly others, can understand.

~~I will migrate date from my old site (someday).~~

**Update**: Migrated content. Hugo was my first choice for new platform. But Hexo made it to top.
