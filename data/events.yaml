- title: Building Resilient Digital Experience Platforms
  description: |
    Navigating the world of cloud-agnostic, resilient digital experience platforms can be a complex task even with Drupal, the leading open-source DXP. Yet, with the right guidance and tools to build cloud-neutral architecture, this task can be managed effectively and efficiently. This recorded webinar delves into the intricacies of constructing modern architectural patterns for Drupal in a distributed cloud environment, by leveraging YugabyteDB. YugabyteDB is an open source  and cloud-agnostic distributed SQL database. Our spotlight will be on resilience, scalability, and reducing total cost of ownership.
